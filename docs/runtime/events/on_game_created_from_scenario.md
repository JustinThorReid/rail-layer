# Event: on_game_created_from_scenario

Called when a game is created from a scenario. This is fired for every mod, even when the scenario's
save data already includes it. In those cases however,
[LuaBootstrap::on_init](runtime:LuaBootstrap::on_init) is not fired.  This event is not fired when
the scenario is loaded via the map editor.
