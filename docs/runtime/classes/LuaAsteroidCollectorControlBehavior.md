# LuaAsteroidCollectorControlBehavior

Control behavior for asteroid collectors.

## Attributes

### `set_filter` — `boolean`

`true` if this asteroid collector has filters set from circuit network

### `read_content` — `boolean`

`true` if this asteroid collector reads its content and sends it to a circuit network

### `include_hands` — `boolean`

`true` if read contents should include content of hands (items that were captured but are not yet in
the asteroid collector's main inventory).

### `valid` — `boolean` (read-only)

Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is
possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua
object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are
advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the
creation of the Lua object and its access.

### `object_name` — `string` (read-only)

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may
also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.
