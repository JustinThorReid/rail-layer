# LuaProfiler

An object used to measure script performance.  Since performance is non-deterministic, these objects
don't allow reading the raw time values from Lua. They can be used anywhere a
[LocalisedString](runtime:LocalisedString) is used, except for
[LuaGuiElement::add](runtime:LuaGuiElement::add)'s LocalisedString arguments,
[LuaSurface::create_entity](runtime:LuaSurface::create_entity)'s `text` argument, and
[LuaEntity::add_market_item](runtime:LuaEntity::add_market_item).

## Attributes

### `valid` — `boolean` (read-only)

Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is
possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua
object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are
advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the
creation of the Lua object and its access.

### `object_name` — `string` (read-only)

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may
also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.

## Methods

### `reset()`

Resets the clock, also restarting it.

### `stop()`

Stops the clock.

### `restart()`

Start the clock again, without resetting it.

### `add(other: LuaProfiler)`

Add the duration of another timer to this timer. Useful to reduce start/stop overhead when
accumulating time onto many timers at once.  If other is running, the time to now will be added.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Optional | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `other` | `LuaProfiler` | no | The timer to add to this timer. |

### `divide(number: double)`

Divides the current duration by a set value. Useful for calculating the average of many iterations.
Does nothing if this isn't stopped.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Optional | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `number` | `double` | no | The number to divide by. Must be > 0. |
