# LuaMiningDrillControlBehavior

Control behavior for mining drills.

## Attributes

### `circuit_read_resources` — `boolean`

`true` if this drill should send the resources in the field to the circuit network.  Which resources
depends on [LuaMiningDrillControlBehavior::resource_read_mode](runtime:LuaMiningDrillControlBehavior
::resource_read_mode)

### `resource_read_mode` — `defines.control_behavior.mining_drill.resource_read_mode`

If the mining drill should send just the resources in its area or the entire field it's on to the
circuit network.

### `resource_read_targets` — `array[LuaEntity]` (read-only)

The resource entities that the mining drill will send information about to the circuit network or an
empty array.

### `valid` — `boolean` (read-only)

Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is
possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua
object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are
advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the
creation of the Lua object and its access.

### `object_name` — `string` (read-only)

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may
also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.
