# LuaSegment

An individual segment of a [LuaSegmentedUnit](runtime:LuaSegmentedUnit). If the segment exists in a
generated chunk, you can access the entity representation using
[LuaSegment::entity](runtime:LuaSegment::entity).

## Attributes

### `prototype` — `LuaEntityPrototype` (read-only)

The prototype for the entity representation of the segment.

### `unit` — `LuaSegmentedUnit` (read-only)

The segmented unit that owns the segment.

### `entity` — `LuaEntity` (read-only) *(optional)*

The actual entity representation of the segment if it exists. A segment's entity will be
automatically destroyed if the segment moves into chunks that have not yet been fully generated or
onto "out-of-map" tiles. Conversely, if a segment moves into a chunk that is fully generated and
onto a non-"out-of-map" tile, then its entity will be created if it doesn't exist yet.

### `position` — `MapPosition` (read-only) *(optional)*

The position of the segment if one has been assigned. A position may not be assigned if the unit's
number of body nodes is fewer than
[LuaSegmentedUnit::max_body_nodes](runtime:LuaSegmentedUnit::max_body_nodes).  This position may be
in an un-generated chunk. Use
[LuaSurface::is_chunk_generated](runtime:LuaSurface::is_chunk_generated) to check before attempting
to access the chunk.  If [LuaSegment::entity](runtime:LuaSegment::entity) is non-nil, this returns
that entity's [LuaEntity::position](runtime:LuaEntity::position). If the entity is `nil`, then
reading this field calculates the entity's would-be position if it existed. This can be expensive to
compute, so avoid reading this field too often unless it is really necessary.

### `orientation` — `RealOrientation` (read-only) *(optional)*

The relative orientation of the segment if one has been assigned. An orientation may not be assigned
if the unit's number of body nodes is fewer than
[LuaSegmentedUnit::max_body_nodes](runtime:LuaSegmentedUnit::max_body_nodes).  If
[LuaSegment::entity](runtime:LuaSegment::entity) is non-nil, this returns that entity's
[LuaEntity::orientation](runtime:LuaEntity::orientation). If the entity is `nil`, then reading this
field calculates the entity's would-be position if it existed. This can be expensive to compute, so
avoid reading this field too often unless it is really necessary.

### `valid` — `boolean` (read-only)

Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is
possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua
object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are
advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the
creation of the Lua object and its access.

### `object_name` — `string` (read-only)

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may
also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.
