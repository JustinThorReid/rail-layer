# LuaFluidPrototype

Prototype of a fluid.

## Attributes

### `default_temperature` — `double` (read-only)

Default temperature of this fluid.

### `max_temperature` — `double` (read-only)

Maximum temperature this fluid can reach.

### `heat_capacity` — `double` (read-only)

The amount of energy in Joules required to heat one unit of this fluid by 1°C.

### `base_color` — `Color` (read-only)

### `flow_color` — `Color` (read-only)

### `gas_temperature` — `double` (read-only)

The temperature above which this fluid will be shown as gaseous inside tanks and pipes.

### `emissions_multiplier` — `double` (read-only)

A multiplier on the amount of emissions produced when this fluid is burnt in a generator. A value
above `1.0` increases emissions and vice versa. The multiplier can't be negative.

### `fuel_value` — `double` (read-only)

The amount of energy in Joules one unit of this fluid will produce when burnt in a generator. A
value of `0` means this fluid can't be used for energy generation. The value can't be negative.

### `factoriopedia_alternative` — `LuaFluidPrototype` (read-only) *(optional)*

An alternative prototype that will be used to display info about this prototype in Factoriopedia.

### `valid` — `boolean` (read-only)

Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is
possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua
object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are
advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the
creation of the Lua object and its access.

### `object_name` — `string` (read-only)

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may
also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.
