# LuaTransportBeltControlBehavior

Control behavior for transport belts.

## Attributes

### `read_contents` — `boolean`

If the belt will read the contents and send them to the circuit network.

### `read_contents_mode` — `defines.control_behavior.transport_belt.content_read_mode`

The read mode for the belt.

### `valid` — `boolean` (read-only)

Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is
possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua
object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are
advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the
creation of the Lua object and its access.

### `object_name` — `string` (read-only)

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may
also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.
