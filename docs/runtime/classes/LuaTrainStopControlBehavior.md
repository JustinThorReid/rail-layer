# LuaTrainStopControlBehavior

Control behavior for train stops.

## Attributes

### `send_to_train` — `boolean`

`true` if the train stop should send the circuit network contents to the train to use.

### `read_from_train` — `boolean`

`true` if the train stop should send the train contents to the circuit network.

### `read_stopped_train` — `boolean`

`true` if the train stop should send the stopped train id to the circuit network.

### `set_trains_limit` — `boolean`

`true` if the trains_limit_signal is used to set a limit of trains incoming for train stop.

### `read_trains_count` — `boolean`

`true` if the train stop should send amount of incoming trains to the circuit network.

### `stopped_train_signal` — `SignalID` *(optional)*

The signal that will be sent when using the send-train-id option.

### `trains_count_signal` — `SignalID` *(optional)*

The signal that will be sent when using the read-trains-count option.

### `trains_limit_signal` — `SignalID` *(optional)*

The signal to be used by set-trains-limit to limit amount of incoming trains

### `set_priority` — `boolean`

`true` if the priority_signal is used to set a priority of the train stop.

### `priority_signal` — `SignalID` *(optional)*

The signal to be used by set-priority change priority of the train stop

### `valid` — `boolean` (read-only)

Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is
possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua
object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are
advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the
creation of the Lua object and its access.

### `object_name` — `string` (read-only)

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may
also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.
