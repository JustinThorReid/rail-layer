# Concept: MouseButtonFlags

A set of flags. Active flags are in the dictionary as `true`, while inactive flags aren't present at
all.  To write to this, use an array[[string](runtime:string)] of the mouse buttons that should be
possible to use with on button. The flag `"left-and-right"` can also be set, which will set `"left"`
and `"right"` to `true`.

**Type:** `dict['left' | 'right' | 'middle' | 'button-4' | 'button-5' | 'button-6' | 'button-7' | 'button-8' | 'button-9', True]`
