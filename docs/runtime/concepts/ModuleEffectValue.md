# Concept: ModuleEffectValue

The percentual increase of the attribute. A value of `0.6` means a 60% increase.  Quality values are
multiplied by
[LuaQualityPrototype::next_probability](runtime:LuaQualityPrototype::next_probability). For example,
if a module's quality effect is 0.2 and the current quality's next_probability is 0.1, then the
chance to get the next quality item is 2%.

**Type:** `float`
