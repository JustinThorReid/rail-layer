# Concept: MapPosition

Coordinates on a surface, for example of an entity. MapPositions may be specified either as a
dictionary with `x`, `y` as keys, or simply as an array with two elements.  The coordinates are
saved as a fixed-size 32 bit integer, with 8 bits reserved for decimal precision, meaning the
smallest value step is `1/2^8 = 0.00390625` tiles.

**Type:** `{x: double, y: double} | (double, double)`
