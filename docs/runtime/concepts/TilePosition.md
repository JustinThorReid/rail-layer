# Concept: TilePosition

Coordinates of a tile on a [LuaSurface](runtime:LuaSurface) where each integer `x`/`y` represents a
different tile. This uses the same format as [MapPosition](runtime:MapPosition), except it rounds
any non-integer `x`/`y` down to whole numbers. It can be specified either with or without explicit
keys.

**Type:** `{x: int32, y: int32} | (int32, int32)`
