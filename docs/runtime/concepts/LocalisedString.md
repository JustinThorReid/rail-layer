# Concept: LocalisedString

Localised strings are a way to support translation of in-game text. They offer a language-
independent code representation of the text that should be shown to players.  It is an array where
the first element is the key and the remaining elements are parameters that will be substituted for
placeholders in the template designated by the key.  The key identifies the string template. For
example, `"gui-alert-tooltip.attack"` (for the template `"__1__ objects are being damaged"`; see the
file `data/core/locale/en.cfg`).  The template can contain placeholders such as `__1__` or `__2__`.
These will be replaced by the respective parameter in the LocalisedString. The parameters themselves
can be other localised strings, which will be processed recursively in the same fashion. Localised
strings can not be recursed deeper than 20 levels and can not have more than 20 parameters.  There
are two special flags for the localised string, indicated by the key being a particular string.
First, if the key is the empty string (`""`), then all parameters will be concatenated (after
processing, if any are localised strings themselves). Second, if the key is a question mark (`"?"`),
then the first valid parameter will be used. A parameter can be invalid if its name doesn't match
any string template. If no parameters are valid, the last one is returned. This is useful to
implement a fallback for missing locale templates.  Furthermore, when an API function expects a
localised string, it will also accept a regular string (i.e. not a table) which will not be
translated, as well as a number, boolean or `nil`, which will be converted to their textual
representation.

**Type:** `string | number | boolean | LuaObject | nil | array[LocalisedString]`
