# Concept: SignalFilter

A signal filter may be specified in two ways, either as a string which is a virtual signal name or
item prototype name or as a table.  When the LogisticFilter that this is used in has a non-zero
`min` value then `comparator` must be `"="` (the default when writing) and `quality` is mandatory.

**Type:** `{comparator: ComparatorString, name: string, quality: QualityID, type: SignalIDType} | string`
