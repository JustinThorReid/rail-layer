# Loader1x2Prototype
*typename: `loader`*
*extends: `LoaderPrototype`*

Continuously loads and unloads machines, as an alternative to inserters.  This loader type is
identical to [Loader1x1Prototype](prototype:Loader1x1Prototype) with the exception of its hardcoded
belt_distance. The belt_distance of the loader determines the distance between the position of this
loader and the tile of the loader's belt target.  This loader type always has a belt_distance of
0.5, meaning by default it is 2 tiles long in total. For a loader type with a belt_distance of 0,
see [Loader1x1Prototype](prototype:Loader1x1Prototype).
