# HighlightBoxEntityPrototype
*typename: `highlight-box`*
*extends: `EntityPrototype`*

Used to attach graphics for [cursor boxes](prototype:CursorBoxType) to entities during runtime.
HighlightBoxEntity can also be independent from entities so it is simply drawn somewhere in the
world. See [LuaSurface::create_entity](runtime:LuaSurface::create_entity) for the available options
for type "highlight-box".  The [collision_box](prototype:EntityPrototype::collision_box) of the
highlight box prototype is ignored during runtime, instead the "bounding_box" given in
create_entity() or the selection box of the target entity is used.
