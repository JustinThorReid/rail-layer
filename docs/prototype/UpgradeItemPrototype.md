# UpgradeItemPrototype
*typename: `upgrade-item`*
*extends: `SelectionToolPrototype`*

An [upgrade planner](https://wiki.factorio.com/Upgrade_planner).  For an entity to be allowed as an
upgrade source, it must be minable, may not have "not-upgradable" flag set and may not be
[hidden](prototype:PrototypeBase::hidden). Additionally, the source entity's mining result must not
be an item product that is [hidden](prototype:ItemPrototype::hidden). Mining results with no item
products are allowed.  For an entity to be allowed as an upgrade target, it must have least 1 item
that builds it that isn't hidden.  For two entities to be upgrades of each other, the two entities
must have the same [fast replaceable group](prototype:EntityPrototype::fast_replaceable_group), the
same [collision box](prototype:EntityPrototype::collision_box) and the same [collision
mask](prototype:EntityPrototype::collision_mask). Additionally, [underground
belts](prototype:UndergroundBeltPrototype) cannot be upgraded to [transport
belts](prototype:TransportBeltPrototype) and vice versa.  For an entity to be automatically upgraded
to another entity without configuring the upgrade planner, the [next
upgrade](prototype:EntityPrototype::next_upgrade) of the upgrade source entity must be set.
